    #B5 outfile/relativeoutfile: If the output format is HTML, escape % in the filename.
    #B5 Recode plain text output to a user-specified charset (make sure the file uses that charset)
    #B5 Save "to a printer" (e.g. use the PDF printer)
    #B5 The footer should be added when the progress listener gets the signal that the download was finished
    #C5 Chain shelves (if A was activated, activate B next)
    #C5 Dialogs: Add drop-down menu for easier insertion of place holders
    #C5 Handle mime/save-format types as object/hash map so that they are easier to maintain
    #E8 Log to sqlite db (or use places/save as bookmark?): But nothing is as easy to post-process as a plain text file
    #E9 Also support UnMHT?
    #E9 Option to select more than one shelf?
